# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
An attempt for doing classification in a highly imbalanced dataset.  

## Techniques tried: 
- SMOTE (upsampling) with Logistic Regression
- SMOTE (upsampling) with Random Forest
- Autoencoders with Support Vector Machines (and t-SNE for visualization)  

**Currently, my aim was not to come up with great results (F1-score) but to understand techniques, so the results can surely be improved significantly**.
